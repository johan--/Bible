    <string name="about_title_nkjv">About the New King James Version (NKJV)</string>
    <string name="about_content_nkjv">The New King James Version is an up-to-date translation of the Bible by devout scholars, it maintains the beauty of the King James Version while increasing the accuracy and making the meaning clearer for today’s reader. The NKJV presents the Bible with updated clarity that readers truly appreciate, and thus is amongst the best Bible translations for studying God’s Word.
The NKJV was commissioned in 1975 by Thomas Nelson Publishers, and more than 120 respected Bible scholars, church leaders, and lay Christians worked for seven years to create a more modern translation of Scripture, yet one that would retain the purity and stylistic beauty of the original King James. Faithfulness to the original Bible texts in Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic, the NKJV translation applies the most recent research in linguistics, archaeology, and textual studies.

    <string name="about_title_niv">About the New International Version (NIV)</string>
    <string name="about_content_niv">The New International Version (NIV) is an English translation of the Christian Bible. The NIV was originally published in the 1970s, after more than five decades of work that united evangelicals in an inter-denominational effort to provide a trustworthy, accessible version of the Bible for the English-speaking world. It was updated in 1984 and again in 2011, and has become one of the best-selling modern translations, with millions relying on this faithful translation of God’s Holy Word.

    <string name="about_title_niv_spanish">About La Santa Biblia, Nueva Version Internacional - (NVI-Spanish)</string>
    <string name="about_content_niv_spanish">In 1979, The International Bible Society (now Biblica®) decided to produce a New Testament in Spanish following the NIV translation principles. For more than ten years the Biblical scholars involved worked to preserve the original language as much as possible while focusing on the target language as well. Many original, well-known phrases were kept, but others were introduced to communicate concepts that had not previously translated smoothly into Spanish.  The NVI-Spanish Bible is an authentic and faithful translation of the original Bible texts into Spanish.
